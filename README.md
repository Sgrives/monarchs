# About

This project attempts to create timelines of the monarchies of major European powers over the last millenia.

I'd like to have an easy visual reference for who was concurrently in power and what events were going on in the world.

In version 2, I'd like to have a way of relating the monarchs to each other via family, marriage, etc.

## Workflow

1. Keep data in [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gn-62AWtt5o4PnbMgzs6VUlbykweki1MGnm5nee7zTM/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Export it to `dataset.json` with [Google Add-On](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-sheet-data/bfdcopkbamihhchdnjghdknibmcnfplk?hl=en)

## To do

- Data
  - Compile and enter all data
- Timeline
  - Cursor tracks year as it moves
  - Wars as rects above monarchy timeline
  - Radio button to select active country; inactive countries have more opacity / less detail
  - Nation-state borders by year
  - Better colors
  - Subtitle
- Details
  - Hyperlinks to events, wars, etc.
  - Replace contemporary paintings with revisionist ones
  - Can click anywhere to dismiss
  - Better spacing vertically
  - Smaller pictures
  - Full names for relationships (e.g. Mary -> Mary of Guise)
  - Local house images
- Compatibility
  - Make it work w/ Firefox & Linux
