# About

This project attempts to create timelines of the monarchies of major European powers over the last millenia.

I'd like to have an easy visual reference for who was concurrently in power and what events were going on in the world.

## Workflow

1. Keep data in [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gn-62AWtt5o4PnbMgzs6VUlbykweki1MGnm5nee7zTM/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Export it to `dataset.json` with [Google Add-On](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-sheet-data/bfdcopkbamihhchdnjghdknibmcnfplk?hl=en)
3. Push to Github repo, served with Github Pages using custom domain
